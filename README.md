# vector-field-analysis-tools
 A Python-based tool to visually represent the curl and divergence of vector fields.
 This repository contains Python scripts to visualize the curl and divergence of vector fields.

## Dependencies
   To run this codes please make sure that you have the latest version of Python ( 3.12.6 or newer )  
   Also you need to use the following libraries :  
   NumPy and matplotlib  

   To Install Numpy in your python libraries use the following in terminal  
    pip install -r numpy  

   To Install matplotlib in your python libraries use the following in terminal  
    pip install -r matplotlib  

 ## Running The Scripts
   To view the curl of the Vector equation :  
    python curl_visualization.py  

   To view the divergence of the Vector equation :  
    python divergence_visualization.py  
    
  ## Customization
   You can customize the vector fields, plot parameters, and visualization styles by modifying the code within the scripts.  
   Here the default vector equation I used is   
   yz i + zx j + xy k = 0
